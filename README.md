# Snake
The game is based on the popular Nokia Game.The snake should move at a constant speed within the walls, with a grid size of N x M.Every tile the snake touches, turns green. Food items (slices of pizza, in this case) are strewn randomly on any non-green tile (tile not yet touched by the snake). The slices have to be within the walls of the game. Each slice stays on screen for ‘n’ number of seconds and then disappears. If it is collected by the snake before time runs out, the score increases by 1.Whenever the snake hits the border, it should bounce off the edge. Imagine that the border is a mirror, and the snake bounces off as if reflecting off the mirror. So, it will be a mirror-reflection bounce effect.The game ends when all tiles turn green.
